# Variable Names
- for class and struct its this case BananaBalloon i forgot what its called
- for variable names its camelCase
# function parameters
- if its in the Data struct, put it in the order of the items in the struct, then put things that are not in the struct first
- if passing something large, pass in by const reference, if its modified pass by pointer, else pass by value
